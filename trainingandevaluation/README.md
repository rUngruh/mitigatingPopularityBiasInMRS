# Putting Popularity Bias Mitigation to the Test: A User-Centric Evaluation in Music Recommenders

## Training and Evaluation

This directory includes the code for training and evaluation of the models used in the paper **Putting Popularity Bias Mitigation to the Test: A User-Centric Evaluation in Music Recommenders**

This module can be used for replicating the models used for the study as explained in the paper.
Please refer to the README of `Init_Preprocessing` first, then train and evaluate the models using `Recommendation_Training_HPC`

The model was trained using a [HPC cloud](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/hpc-cloud).
The scripts can be adapted to run on a local machine.

Code for the study tool used in the work: ### add paper ###

This module can be used for replicating the models used for the study as explained in the paper.
Please refer to the README of "Init_Preprocessing" first, then train and evaluate the models using "Recommendation_Training_HPC"

The model was trained using a HPC cloud (https://www.surf.nl/en/services/hpc-cloud).
Nonetheless, the scripts can be adapted to run on a local machine.
